# SOLID Principles Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to improve adherence to SOLID principles in the FastDeploy project.

## Overview of Changes

The codebase has been refactored to better follow SOLID principles, with a focus on:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has one responsibility
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes can be substituted for their base types
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules

## Specific Improvements

### 1. Docker Service Refactoring

#### Before:
- `DockerServiceInterface` had multiple responsibilities
- Error handling was inconsistent
- Methods returned strings instead of structured data
- Direct dependency on `VariableStore`

#### After:
- Split into `ContainerServiceInterface` and `ComposeServiceInterface`
- Improved error handling with descriptive messages
- Methods return structured data ([]string)
- Removed direct dependency on `VariableStore`
- Added comprehensive documentation

### 2. Project Service Refactoring

#### Before:
- `ProjectServiceInterface` had multiple responsibilities
- Error handling was verbose and repetitive
- Business logic mixed with infrastructure concerns
- ID generation logic in the service

#### After:
- Split into `ProjectLoaderInterface`, `ProjectPersisterInterface`, and `ProjectInitializerInterface`
- Improved error handling with descriptive messages
- Extracted ID generation to a utility package
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Better method names and organization

### 3. Deployment Service Refactoring

#### Before:
- Methods directly modified the deployment object
- Inconsistent naming (DeploymentService vs DeploymentServiceInterface)
- Limited error handling
- Multiple methods for related functionality

#### After:
- Consistent naming and interface structure
- Improved error handling with descriptive messages
- Combined related methods into a single `prepareDeployment` method
- Added comprehensive documentation

### 4. Utility Package

- Created a new `util` package for shared functionality
- Implemented `GenerateID` function for creating unique IDs
- Follows SRP by isolating this functionality

### 5. Main Application

- Reorganized service initialization for better readability
- Grouped services by layer (infrastructure, domain)
- Improved comments

## Benefits

These refactoring changes provide several benefits:

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Code is more modular and easier to understand
2. **Better Testability**: Smaller interfaces are easier to mock and test
3. **Enhanced Flexibility**: Components can be extended without modifying existing code
4. **Reduced Coupling**: Dependencies are more explicit and manageable
5. **Clearer Intent**: Better naming and documentation make the code's purpose clearer

## Next Steps

Further improvements could include:

1. Adding unit tests for the refactored components
2. Implementing a dependency injection container
3. Further splitting large services into smaller, more focused ones
4. Applying similar principles to other parts of the codebase

## Recent Improvements (May 2024)

### 1. Module and Go Version

- Fixed Go version in `go.mod` to a valid version (1.22)
- Updated module name for consistency

### 2. Interface-Based Design for Path Service

#### Before:
- `PathService` was in `internal/domain/common/path/` with no interface
- Error handling was inconsistent (sometimes returning errors, sometimes empty strings)
- No clear separation between interface and implementation

#### After:
- Created a `PathService` interface in `internal/domain/port/path_service.go`
- Implemented `OsPathService` in `internal/infrastructure/adapter/os_path_service.go`
- Improved error handling consistency
- Added comprehensive documentation

### 3. Recommendations for Further Improvements

#### Architecture and Organization
1. **Move Common Utilities**: Move common utilities from `internal/domain/common/` to a more appropriate location like `internal/pkg/` or `pkg/`.
2. **Define Interfaces for All Domain Services**: Define interfaces for all domain services in `internal/domain/port/` to improve testability and provide clear contracts.
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Standardize error handling across the codebase. Currently, some functions return errors directly, while others wrap them in `InfraResultEntity`.
4. **Use Context Propagation**: Ensure that `context.Context` is propagated through all layers of the application for proper cancellation and timeout handling.
5. **Add Observability**: Implement structured logging, metrics, and tracing using OpenTelemetry to improve observability.

#### Code Quality
1. **Add Tests**: Add unit tests for all components, especially domain services and repositories.
2. **Improve Documentation**: Add godoc-style comments to all exported functions and types.
3. **Use Linters**: Configure and use linters like `golangci-lint` to enforce code quality standards.
4. **Reduce Duplication**: Identify and eliminate code duplication, especially in the Docker-related code.

#### Dependencies
1. **Clean Up Indirect Dependencies**: Run `go mod tidy` to clean up indirect dependencies in `go.mod`.
2. **Vendor Dependencies**: Consider vendoring dependencies for better reproducibility.

#### Configuration
1. **Use Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration instead of hardcoded values.
2. **Add Configuration Validation**: Validate configuration values at startup to fail fast if there are issues.

#### Security
1. **Add Input Validation**: Add input validation for all user inputs to prevent security issues.
2. **Use Secure Defaults**: Ensure that all security-related settings use secure defaults.
